### Notes

- Replace `<PRODUCT_ID>` with the actual product ID (string).
- All prices are in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents).
- For products with variants, set `"price": 0` in the main product and specify prices in each variant.
- The API returns JSON responses.

If you need example responses or more advanced queries, let me know!
